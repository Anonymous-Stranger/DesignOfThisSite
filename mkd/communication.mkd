Word choice has huge impact on which users can understand and easily use a site. If your word choice misses your target audience, your whole website will miss them too.

Material Design suggests the use of terms that are as simple as possible. This is also important for international users. It's very bad to use local slang or jargon. Contractions (it's, for example) are good because they make your sentences shorter without side-effects.

This website uses the simplest language we could find without sacrificing meaning.
