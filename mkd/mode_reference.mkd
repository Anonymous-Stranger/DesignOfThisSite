We designed reference mode for users who are returning to the site, or just want to look at one part of the design. Because reference mode needs to cover every aspect of the design, users need to be able to go to any part of the design easily.

Users can find relevant about a design element they're looking at using the question mark icon. They can also browse the table of contents, which is accessible through the menu icon. If a user follows a link in the table of contents during story mode, the back arrow can return them to wherever they were before, so they don't lose track.
