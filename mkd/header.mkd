The header holds important options for the user. It should be available wherever the user goes to make those options available.

Our header shows the user where they are, and helps them access the table of contents. It strengthens the brand by displaying the site's primary color.

As suggested by Material Design, our header appears to raise itself above other elements when it goes over them, to make its movement more intuitive to the user.
