Google's Material Design guidelines are a well-known and comprehensive design methodology for mobile application user interfaces. The goal of the methodology is to make apps that are easy to use and understand.

Material Design enforces the use of flat, simple pieces of "paper", layered parallel to one another. It includes rules about how these should move, how text should be placed on them, how layouts should work and just about every other aspect of design.
